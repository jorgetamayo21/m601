This Python script allows you to control the Redragon M601-RGB gaming mouse from your terminal!

**Disclaimer: This software is not supported by the manufacturer of the hardware in any way, and relies completely on information from reverse-engineering. There is no warranty, especially in case of damage to the hardware**

**Please, don't use this software yet.  While experimenting with mouse settings, I somehow managed to write the wrong values into my mouse and brick it.  The original software failed to restore settings, so I did it myself using information from previously captured packets.  And now, even though it works perfectly, it reacts strangely to backlight settings and returns wrong data when I try to read settings from it into a .ini file. I'm working on getting everything back to how it was, but for now, please don't use this software because you risk breaking your mouse.**
